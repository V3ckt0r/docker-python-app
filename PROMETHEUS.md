# Getting started

## Getting Prometheus
Download the latest binary release of Prometheus for your platform from:

https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases

Extract the contents into a new directory and change to that directory.

Example for Linux:

If you're using Prometheus 0.16.0, the tarball already extracts into a separate
sub-directory:

```
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v1.0.1/prometheus-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xfvz prometheus-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-1.0.1.linux-amd64
```

## Configuring Prometheus to monitor itself

Take a look at the included example `prometheus.yml` configuration file. It
configures global options, as well as a single job to scrape metrics from: the
Prometheus server itself.

Prometheus collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP
endpoints on these targets. Since Prometheus also exposes data in the same
manner about itself, it may also be used to scrape and monitor its own health.
While a Prometheus server which collects only data about itself is not very
useful in practice, it is a good starting example.

## Starting Prometheus
Start Prometheus. By default, Prometheus reads its config from a file
called `prometheus.yml` in the current working directory, and it
stores its database in a sub-directory called `data`, again relative
to the current working directory. Both behaviors can be changed using
the flags `-config.file` or `-storage.local.path`, respectively.

```
./prometheus -config.file=prometheus.yml -storage.local.path=data
```

Prometheus should start up and it should show the targets it scrapes at
[http://localhost:9090/targets](http://localhost:9090/targets). You
will find [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) in the
list of scraped targets. Give Prometheus a couple of seconds to start
collecting data about itself from its own HTTP metrics endpoint.

You can also verify that Prometheus is serving metrics about itself by
navigating to its metrics exposure endpoint:
[http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics).

## Using the expression browser
The query interface at
[http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/) allows you to
explore metric data collected by the Prometheus server. At the moment, the
server is only scraping itself. The collected metrics are already quite
interesting, though.  The *Console* tab shows the most recent value of metrics,
while the *Graph* tab plots values over time. The latter can be quite expensive
(for both the server and the browser). It is in general a good idea to try
potentially expensive expressions in the *Console* tab first. Take a bit of
time to play with the expression browser. Suggestions:

* Evaluate `prometheus_local_storage_ingested_samples_total`, which shows you
  the total number of ingested samples over the lifetime of the server. In the
  *Graph* tab, it will show as steadily increasing.
* The expression `prometheus_local_storage_ingested_samples_total[1m]`
  evaluates to all sample values of the metric in the last minute. It cannot be
  plotted as a graph, but in the *Console* tab, you see a list of the values with
  (Unix) timestamp.
* `rate(prometheus_local_storage_ingested_samples_total[1m])` calculates the
  rate (increase per second) over the 1m timeframe. In other words, it tells you
  how many samples per second your server is ingesting. This expression can be
  plotted nicely, and it will become more interesting as you add more targets.

## Start the node exporter
The node exporter is a server that exposes system statistics about the machine
it is running on as Prometheus metrics.

Download the latest node exporter binary release for your platform from:

https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases

Beware that the majority of the node exporter's functionality is
Linux-specific, so its exposed metrics will be significantly reduced when
running it on other platforms.

Linux example:

```
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/0.12.0/node_exporter-0.12.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz node_exporter-0.12.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-0.12.0.linux-amd64
```

Start the node exporter:

```
./node_exporter
```

## Configure Prometheus to monitor the node exporter

If you are not running your local node exporter under Linux, you might want to
point your Prometheus server to a Linux node exporter run by one of your peers
in the workshop. Or point it to a node exporter we are running during the
workshop at
[http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics](http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics).

Add the following job configuration to the `scrape_configs:` section
in `prometheus.yml` to monitor both your own and the demo node
exporter:

```
  - job_name: 'node'
    scrape_interval: '15s'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - 'localhost:9100'
          - 'demo.robustperception.io:9100'
```

Send your Prometheus server a `SIGHUP` to initiate a reload of the configuration:

```
killall -HUP prometheus
```

Then check the *Status* page of your Prometheus server to make sure the node
exporter is scraped correctly. Shortly after, a whole lot of interesting
metrics will show up in the expression browser, each of them starting with
`node_`. (Reload the page to see them in the autocompletion.) As an example,
have a look at `node_cpu`.

The node exporter has a whole lot of modules to export machine
metrics. Have a look at the
[README.md](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to get an
idea. While Prometheus is particularly good at collecting service
metrics, correlating those with system metrics from individual
machines can be immensely helpful.  (Perhaps that one task that showed
high latency yesterday was scheduled on a node with a lot of competing
disk operations?)

## Use the node exporter to export the contents of a text file
The *textfile* module of the node exporter can be used to expose static
machine-level metrics (such as what role a machine has) or the outcome of
machine-tied batch jobs (such as a Chef client run). To use it, create a
directory for the text files to export and (re-)start the node exporter with
the `-collector.textfile.directory` flag set. Finally, create a text file in
that directory.

```
mkdir textfile-exports
./node_exporter --collector.textfile.directory=textfile-exports
echo 'role{role="workshop_node_exporter"} 1' > textfile-exports/role.prom.$$
mv textfile-exports/role.prom.$$ textfile-exports/role.prom
```

For details, see the
[documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector).

## Configuring targets with service discovery

Above you have seen how to configure multiple targets. You can also
have multiple `- targets: [...]` sub-sections in the `static_configs`
section, each with a different set of labels.

Prometheus adds an `instance` label with the hostname and port as the value to
each metric scraped from any target. With that label, you can later aggregate
or separate metrics from different targets.

In practice, configuring many targets statically is often a
maintenance burden.  The solution is service discovery. Currently,
Prometheus supports service discovery via a number of methods. Here,
we will look at service discovery via DNS SRV records. To try out a
DNS SRV record, we have created one for `_demo-node._tcp.prometheus.io`:

```
dig +short SRV _demo-node._tcp.prometheus.io
```

Only one host and port is returned (the already known `_demo-node._tcp.prometheus.io`
on port 9100), but any number of host/port combinations could be part of the
SRV record. Prometheus regularly polls the DNS information and dynamically
adjusts the targets. To configure a job with DNS service discovery, add the
following to `prometheus.yml`:

```
- job_name: 'discovered_node'
  dns_sd_configs:
    - names:
        - '_demo-node._tcp.prometheus.io'
```

# The expression language

With more metrics collected by your Prometheus server, it is time to
familiarize yourself a bit more with the expression language. For comprehensive
documentation, check out the
[querying chapter](http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics/). The following
is meant as an inspiration for how to play with the metrics currently collected
by your server. Evaluate them in the *Console* and *Graph* tab. For the latter,
try different time ranges and the *stacked* option.

## The `rate()` function
Prometheus internally organizes sample data in chunks. It performs a number of
different chunk operations on them and exposes them as
`prometheus_local_storage_chunk_ops_total`, which is comprised of a number of
counters, one per possible chunk operation. To see a rate of chunk operations
per second, use the rate function over a time range that should cover at least
a handful of scrape intervals.

```
rate(prometheus_local_storage_chunk_ops_total[1m])
```

Now you can see the rate for each chunk operation type.  Note that the rate
function handles counter resets (for example if a binary is restarted).
Whenever a counter goes down, the function assumes that a counter reset has
happened and the counter has started counting from `0`.

## The `sum` aggregation operator
If you want to get the total rate for all operations, you need to sum up the
rates:

```
sum(rate(prometheus_local_storage_chunk_ops_total[1m]))
```

Note that you need to take the sum of the rate, and not the rate of the sum.
(Exercise for the reader: Why?)

## Select by label
If you want to look only at the persist operation, you can filter by label with
curly braces:

```
rate(prometheus_local_storage_chunk_ops_total{type="persist"}[1m])
```

You can use multiple label pairs within the curly braces (comma-separated), and
the match can be inverted (with `!=`) or performed with a regular expression
(with `=~`, or `!~` for the inverted match).

(Exercise: How to estimate the average number of samples per chunk?)

## Aggregate by label
The metric `http_request_duration_microseconds_count` counts the number of HTTP
requests processed. (Disregard the `duration_microseconds` part for now. It
will be explained later.) If you look at it in the *Console* tab, you can see
the many time series with that name. The metric is partitioned by handler,
instance, and job, resulting in many sample values at any given time. We call
that an instant vector.

If you are only interested in which job is serving how many QPS, you can let
the sum operator aggregate by job (resulting in the two jobs we are monitoring,
the Prometheus itself and the node exporter):

```
sum(rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count[5m])) by (job)
```

A combination of label pairs is possible, too. You can aggregate by job and
instance (which is interesting if you have added an additional node exporter to
your config):

```
sum(rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count[5m])) by (job, instance)
```

Note that there is an alternative syntax with the `by` clause following
directly the aggregation operator. This syntax is particularly useful in
complex nested expressions, where it otherwise becomes difficult to spot which
`by` clause belongs to which operator.

```
sum by (job, instance) (rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count[5m]))
```

## Arithmetic
There is a metric `http_request_duration_microseconds_sum`, which sums up the
duration of all HTTP requests. If the labels match, you can easily divide two
instant vectors, yielding the average request duration in this case:

```
rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count[5m])
```

You can aggregate as above if you do it separately for numerator and
denominator:

```
sum(rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_sum[5m])) by (job) / sum(rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count[5m])) by (job)
```

Things become more interesting if the labels do not match perfectly
between two instant vectors or you want to match vector elements in a
many-to-one or one-to-many fashion. See the
[vector-matching section](http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/operators/#vector-matching)
in the documentation for details.

## Summaries
Rather than an average request duration, you will be more often interested in
quantiles like the median or the 90th percentile. To serve that need,
Prometheus offers summaries. `http_request_duration_microseconds` is a summary
of HTTP request durations, and `http_request_duration_microseconds_sum` and
`http_request_duration_microseconds_count` are merely byproducts of that
summary.  If you look at `http_request_duration_microseconds` in the expression
browser, you see a multitude of time series, as the metric is now partitioned
by quantile, too. An expression like
`http_request_duration_microseconds{quantile="0.9"}` displays the 90th
percentile request duration. You might be tempted to aggregate the result as
you have done above. Not possible, unfortunately. Welcome to the wonderland of
statistics.

Read more about
[histograms and summaries](http://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/)
in the documentation.

## Recording rules
In your practical work with Prometheus at scale, you will pretty soon run into
expressions that are very expensive and slow to evaluate. The remedy is
*recording* rules, a way to tell Prometheus to pre-calculate expressions,
saving the result in a new time series, which can then be used instead of the
expensive expression. See the documentation for details:
* [General documentation about rules](http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/rules/).
* [Best practices for naming rules](http://prometheus.io/docs/practices/).

# Instrument code: Go

*This section is about instrumenting a Go application. If you prefer
 Python, continue with the next section.*

## The example application

The example application is in the same GitHub repository as these
instructions. If you have not done so yet, clone the repository:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/

Study the code to understand what it is doing. Note that the
application has been kept very simple for demonstration purposes and
implements a server and a client in the same binary.

## Instrument it
Instrument the server part with Prometheus. Things to keep in mind:

# Dashboard Building: Console Templates
Console templates are a built-in dashboarding system in the Prometheus server.
They are based on Go's templating language, which is more strongly typed than a
typical web templating engine.

You can see an example at
[http://localhost:9090/consoles/node.html](http://localhost:9090/consoles/node.html).

Task: Create a dashboard of QPS, latency, and "up" servers for the Go/Python
code you instrumented above.

The `consoles` directory that was part of the Prometheus tar-ball
unpacked above contains a number of examples you can take as a base to
work off. Look at `cassandra.html` for a start. (You can also access
the
[consoles directory on GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/consoles/cassandra.html).)

# Dashboard Building: PromDash

TODO: PromDash is deprecated. Replace this section with Grafana. See
https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/

PromDash is a browser-based dashboard builder for Prometheus. It is a Rails
application and stores its dashboard metadata in a configurable SQL backend.
The actual graph data is retrieved by the browser via AJAX requests from the
configured Prometheus servers.

Follow the installation procedure at https://github.com/prometheus/promdash/blob/master/README.md.

Let's create a dashboard to monitor the health of the Prometheus instance
itself:

1. Head over to http://localhost:3000 and click "New Dashboard".
2. Create a dashboard called "&lt;username&gt;-workshop" (you don't need to select a
   directory). PromDash will redirect you to your new, empty dashboard.
3. Set the "Range" input field just under the dashboard title to "30m" to show
   the last 30 minutes of data in the dashboard (feel free to play with the graph
   time range later).

Let's create a graph that shows the ingested samples per second:

1. Click on the "Datasources" menu item in the header line of the empty graph.
2. Click "Add Expression" and set the expression to
   `rate(prometheus_local_storage_ingested_samples_total[1m])`
   The graph should show the per-second rate of ingested samples.
3. Let's give the graph a title. Open the "Graph and axis settings" graph menu
   and set the title to "Ingested samples [rate-1m]".
4. Open the "Legend Settings" graph menu and set "Show legend" to "never",
   since this graph only contains a single time series.
5. Press "Save Changes" to save your progress.

Let's add another graph showing the rates of the various chunk operations:

1. Click the "Add Graph" button to add a second graph.
2. Add the following expression to the graph:

   `rate(prometheus_local_storage_chunk_ops_total[1m])`

   The graph should now show the per-second rate of chunk operations of various kinds.
3. Set the graph title to "Chunk ops [rate-1m]".
4. The legend currently shows all labels of the returned time series, although
   only the "chunk" label differs. To show only that label in the legend, click
   the "Legend Settings" tab and set the existing "Legend format" input to
   `{{type}}`.
5. Because a graph may have multiple expressions with different applicable
   legend format strings each, we still need to assign each legend format string
   to a particular expression. Open the "Datasources" graph menu again and in the
   "- Select format string -" dropdown, select the format string that you just
   created.
6. Press "Save Changes" to save your progress.

Finally, let's add a gauge that shows the number of expression queries
performed against your Prometheus server per second:

1. Click the "Add Gauge" button to add a gauge.
2. Set the gauge expression to:

   `scalar(sum(rate(http_request_duration_microseconds_count{handler=~"/api/query"}[1m])))`

   The gauge should now show the number of expression queries per second. Note
   that a gauge only supports queries which result in scalar values without any
   labels. Thus, the entire expression is wrapped in a scalar() call.
3. Under the "Chart settings" menu tab of your gauge, set the title to
   "Expression queries [rate-1m]".
4. Let's adjust the gauge's maximum value. In the "Chart settings" menu tab of
   the gauge, set the "Gauge Max" to a lower value that seems reasonable for the
   rate of queries your server is getting. For example, try setting it to 5.
5. Press "Save Changes" to save your progress.

Your dashboard should now look somewhat like this:

[![PromDash screenshot](/images/promdash.png)](#promdash)

PromDash supports many more features which we will not be able to explore in
this workshop. For example:

* graphing multiple expressions from different servers in the same graph
* mapping expressions to different axes and setting various axis options
* building templatized dashboards using template variables
* adding pie charts, Graphite graphs, or arbitrary web content

For a more comprehensive overview, see the [PromDash
documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/promdash/).

# Alerting

With instrumentation and a meaningful dashboard in place, the time is
ripe to think about alerting.  Alerting rules are set up similarly to
recording rules.  See the
[section about alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/rules/)
in the documentation. You can inspect the status of configured alerts
in the Alerts section of the Prometheus server's status page
[http://localhost:9090/alerts](http://localhost:9090/alerts). However,
for proper notifications, you need to set up an
[Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).

To play with the Alertmanager, you can download a release from
https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases.

TODO: Alertmanager setup instructions.

In the workshop, we will run the Alertmanager without any configured
notifications, just to see how alerts arrive there. In practice, you want to
configure one of the many notification methods described
[in the docmentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/). Pay
special attention to the aggregation rules, which allow you to route alerts to
different destinations.

To point your Prometheus server to an Alertmanager, use the `-alertmanager.url`
flag.

Alerting rules use the same expression language as used for graphing
before. Here is an example for a very fundamental alerting rule:

```
# Alert for any monitored instance that is unreachable for >2 minutes.
ALERT InstanceDown
  IF up == 0
  FOR 2m
  LABELS {
    severity="page"
  }
  ANNOTATIONS {
    runbook = "Instance {{$labels.instance}} down",
    description = "{{$labels.instance}} of job {{$labels.job}} has been down for more than 2 minutes.",
    runbook = "http://sinsip.com/xm.jpg"
  }
```

Add the rule to a configured rule file, reload the config, and observe the
_Alerts_ tab on the Prometheus server status page and the _Alerts_ tab on the
Alertmanager status page while you start and stop jobs monitored by your
server.

For meaningful alerting, refer to the
[best practices section about alerting](http://prometheus.io/docs/practices/alerting/).

Create a useful alerting rule for your example application and try it out. Possible tasks:
* Create an alert on your service being down. Stop the service and
  check if and when the alert fires.
* The example service simulates short outages now and then. Create an
  alert that will detect them.
* Modify the code to simulate other kinds of outages and create alerts to
  detect them.
* Run the example service multiple times (on different ports). Create
  alerts that fire if a certain percentage of replicas are down.
* Create an alert that fires if the disk is predicted to run full
  within the next six
  hours. ([Hint](http://www.robustperception.io/reduce-noise-from-disk-space-alerts/)
  for cheaters.)

# Pushing Metrics

Occasionally, you might need to push metrics that are not
machine-related. (The latter would be exposed via the `textfile`
module of the node exporter, see above.) The
[Pushgateway](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/) is a
possible solution in that case. Note that it is not meant to change
Prometheus's semantics to a push-based model.

To play with the Pushgateway, you can download a release from
https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/releases or build one from source
yourself.

Configure your Prometheus server to scrape the Pushgateway. The scrape config
for a Pushgateway should have `honor_labels` set to `true`. (Later, you can try
out what happens if you leave it at its default value `false`.)

```
- job_name: 'pushgateway'
  scrape_interval: '15s'
  honor_labels: true
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - 'http://localhost:9091/metrics'
```

Prometheus client libraries allow you to push to the Pushgateway, but you can
also push in a very simple way using `curl`. Imagine a script that runs a
database backup via some kind of (possibly distributed) cron solution. Upon
successful completion, it should report the completion timestamp.

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Some command that creates the backup.

echo "db_backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds $(date +%s)" | curl --data-binary @- http://demo-node.prometheus.io:9091/metrics/job/foo_db
```

Check the status page of the Pushgateway and its `/metrics` endpoint for the
pushed metrics, and then observe how it is ingested by Prometheus.  Pay special
attention to the difference between the scrape timestamp and the timestamp that
is the value of the metric. How would you graph the age of the backup? How
would you alert on a backup too old?
